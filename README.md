smash3ds_replaytool.c: This is a tool for smashbros 3DS replays stored in extdata, mainly for updating the checksum. With some adjustments this should work with the other files in smash3ds extdata too. This tool is originally from roughly December 2014.

See this project github wiki for more Smash info, such as Smash Amiibo.
